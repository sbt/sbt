# In this test, we have a project `a`, on which a project `b` depends.
# project `a` has a library dependency on:
# - "a" % "b" % "1.0.0" % "compile->runtime"
# - "a" % "b" % "1.0.0" % "compile->runtime2"
# project "b" depends on:
# - project `a`
# - "b" % "b" % "1.0.1" % "compile->runtime"
# "a" % "b" % "1.0.0" will be evicted in favor of "a" % "b" % "1.0.1", but we
# have to keep the dependency on the two configurations "runtime" and "runtime2".
# This test makes sure that we actually do.

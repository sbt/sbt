# a test to verify that a bad build definition doesn't hang scripted tests
# and that scripted can recover when reload is expected to fail

$ copy-file bad.sbt.disabled bad.sbt

# removing the problematic build should allow the next command to continue
$ delete bad.sbt

# due to the previous reload failing, this will force the project to be reloaded first
# and this should then succeed

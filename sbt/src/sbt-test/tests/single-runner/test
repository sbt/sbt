#This test that the framework will only use a single runner instance to execute all tests.
#Because ScalaTest's runner will report RunStarting when the run start, a CustomReporter is 
#used to report expected ScalaTest's RunStarting event by writing out to target/, it is then 
#used to check for their existence, and if the expected event is fired > 1 (which is unexpected), 
#a xxxx-2 file will be written, thus here we also check for 'absent' of such file.

# This test is twofold:
# .
#  - it checks the junit xml report format (provided by `JUnitXmlTestsListener`)
# .
#  - it checks the segregation of test output. When tests run concurrently things printed on the standard output
#    get mixed up. SBT can tell the test output appart so that each test is reported with its own standard output.
# .
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .
# for now test output segregation works only in fork mode
> set fork in Test := true

# try parallel first (as it is more likely to fail than its serial counterpart)
> set testForkedParallel := true
-> test
> checkReport

> clean
> checkNoReport

> set testForkedParallel := false
-> test
> checkReport

# TODO - check non-forked mode

# there might be discrepancies between the 'normal' and the 'forked' mode

# > set fork in Test := false
# > clean
# > checkNoReport

# -> test
# > checkReport

## AND serial non-forked...

#Test the framework will call Runner.done once.
#Because ScalaTest's runner will report RunCompleted when the run completed, a CustomReporter is 
#used to report expected ScalaTest's RunCompleted event by writing out to target/, it is then 
#used to check for their existence, and if the expected event is fired > 1 (which is unexpected), 
#a xxxx-2 file will be written, thus here we also check for 'absent' of such file.
#ResourcefulReporter's dispose method will be called in Runner.done also, and it should be called 
#once only.

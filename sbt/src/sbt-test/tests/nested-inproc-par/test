#This test that the framework will execute ScalaTest nested suites as parallel nested task (InProcess) properly.
#A CustomReporter is used to report expected ScalaTest's events by writing out to files in target/, 
#it is then used to check for their existence, and if the expected event is fired > 1 (which is unexpected), 
#a xxxx-2 file will be written, thus here we also check for 'absent' of such file.

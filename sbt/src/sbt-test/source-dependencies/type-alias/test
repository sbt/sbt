# Test for proper detection of structure change when two type aliases
# that dealias to the same type are involved
# See https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/736 for details

# compile both `Foo.scala` and `Bar.scala`
> compile
# change return type of `Foo.foo` method from `Foo.S1` to
# `Foo.S2`
$ copy-file changes/Foo1.scala src/main/scala/Foo.scala
# recompile
#> compile
# verify that change of the return type of `Foo.foo` triggered
# recompilation of `Bar.scala`
> verify-recompiled

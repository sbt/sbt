#This test verifies two things:
# 1) That sbt properly puts resources from src/main/resources on the runtime classpath
# 2) That sbt properly packages resources from src/main/resources into the jar

# This should fail because the Main object is in package jartest and the resource is directly
# in src/main/resources
-> run

> package

# This should fail because sbt should include the resource in the jar but it won't have the right
# directory structure
-$ exec java -jar ./target/out/jvm/scala-3.3.1/main-resources-test/main-resources-test-0.1.jar

# Give the resource the right directory structure
$ mkdir src/main/resources/jartest
$ copy-file src/main/resources/main_resource_test src/main/resources/jartest/main_resource_test
$ delete src/main/resources/main_resource_test

# This should succeed because sbt should put the resource on the runClasspath
> run

# This is necessary because package bases whether or not to run on last modified times, which don't have
# high enough resolution to notice the above move of main_resource_test
> clean

> package

# This should succeed because sbt should include the resource in the jar with the right directory structure
$ exec java -jar ./target/out/jvm/scala-3.3.1/main-resources-test/main-resources-test-0.1.jar

## Scala tools are resolved using ivy, so did we lose the ability to use the same Scala instance that sbt runs with?
##
## It can use the Scala REPL for the version of Scala that sbt runs with
#> console
##
## A different version of Scala needs to be resolved, but we don't have any resolvers configured
#> ++2.8.2
#-> console
##
## With an explicit scalaInstance, the Scala tools configuration won't be resolved
#$ copy-file changes/explicitInstance.sbt explicitInstance.sbt
#> reload
#> console

### HTTPS related changes

Thanks to Sonatype, HTTPS access to Maven Central Repository is available to public. This is now enabled by default, but if HTTP is required for some reason the following system properties can be used:

    -Dsbt.repository.secure=false

Java.net Maven 2 repository, Typesafe repository, and sbt Plugin repository also defaults to HTTPS.

[#1494][1494] by [@rtyley][@rtyley], [#1536][1536] by [@benmccann][@benmccann], and [#1541][1541] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### enablePlugins/disablePlugins

sbt 0.13.6 now allows `enablePlugins` and `disablePlugins` to be written directly in `build.sbt`. [#1213][1213]/[#1312][1312] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Unresolved dependencies error

sbt 0.13.6 will try to reconstruct dependencies tree when it fails to resolve a managed dependency.
This is an approximation, but it should help you figure out where the problematic dependency is coming from. When possible sbt will display the source position next to the modules:

    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  ::          UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES         ::
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn]  :: foundrylogic.vpp#vpp;2.2.1: not found
    [warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
    [warn] 
    [warn]  Note: Unresolved dependencies path:
    [warn]      foundrylogic.vpp:vpp:2.2.1
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne:cayenne-tools:3.0.2
    [warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne.plugins:maven-cayenne-plugin:3.0.2 (/foo/some-test/build.sbt#L28)
    [warn]        +- d:d_2.10:0.1-SNAPSHOT

[#528][528]/[#1422][1422]/[#1447][1447] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Eviction warnings

sbt 0.13.6 displays eviction warnings when it resolves your project's managed dependencies via `update` task.
Currently the eviction warnings are categorized into three layers: `scalaVersion` eviction, direct evictions, and transitive evictions.
By default eviction warning on `update` task will display only `scalaVersion` evictin and direct evictions.

`scalaVersion` eviction warns you when `scalaVersion` is no longer effecitive. This happens when one of your dependency depends on a newer release of scala-library than your `scalaVersion`.
Direct evctions are evictions related to your direct dependencies. Warnings are displayed only when API incompatibility is suspected. For Java libraries, Semantic Versioning is used for guessing, and for Scala libraries Second Segment versioning (second segment bump makes API incompatible) is used.

To display all eviction warnings with caller information, run `evicted` task.

    [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
    [warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
    [warn]     * com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.10:2.1.4 -> 2.3.4 (caller: com.typesafe.akka:akka-remote_2.10:2.3.4,
    org.w3:banana-sesame_2.10:0.4, org.w3:banana-rdf_2.10:0.4)

[#1200][1200]/[#1467][1467] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Latest SNAPSHOTs

sbt 0.13.6 adds a new setting key called `updateOptions` for customizing the details of managed dependency resolution with `update` task. One of its flags is called `lastestSnapshots`, which controls the behavior of the chained resolver. Up until 0.13.6, sbt was picking the first `-SNAPSHOT` revision it found along the chain. When `latestSnapshots` is enabled (default: `true`), it will look into all resolvers on the chain, and compare them using the publish date.

The tradeoff is probably a longer resolution time if you have many remote repositories on the build or you live away from the severs. So here's how to disable it:

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withLatestSnapshots(false)

[#1514][1514] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Consolidated resolution

`updateOptions` can also be used to enable consolidated resolution for `update` task.

    updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withConsolidatedResolution(true)

This feature is specifically targeted to address [Ivy resolution is beging slow for multi-module projects #413][413]. Consolidated resolution aims to fix this issue by artificially constructing an Ivy dependency graph for the unique managed dependencies. If two subprojects introduce identical external dependencies, both subprojects should consolidate to the same graph, and therefore resolve immediately for the second `update`.

### autoStartServer setting

sbt 1.1.1 adds a new global `Boolean` setting called `autoStartServer`, which is set to `true` by default.
When set to `true`, sbt shell will automatically start sbt server. Otherwise, it will not start the server until `startServer` command is issued. This could be used to opt out of server for security reasons.

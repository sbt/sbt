### Fixes with compatibility implications

- sbt 0.13.14 removes the Maven version range when possible. See below.

### Improvements

- Adds preliminary compatibility with JDK 9. Using this requires 0.13.14+ launcher. [#2951][2951]/[143][143] by [@retronym][@retronym]
- Adds "local-preloaded" repository for offline installation. See below.
- Notifies and enables users to stay in sbt's shell on the warm JVM by hitting `[ENTER]` while sbt is running. [#2987][2987]/[#2996][2996] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]
- Adds an `Append` instance to support `sourceGenerators += Def.task { ... }`, instead of needing `.taskValue`. [#2943][2943] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Writes out the sbt.version in project/build.properties if it is missing. [#754][]/[#3025][] by [@dwijnand][]
- XML generated by JUnitXmlTestsListener now correctly flags ignored, skipped and pending tests. [#2198][2198]/[#2854][2854] by [@ashleymercer][@ashleymercer]
- When sbt detects that the project is compiled with dotty, it now automatically
  sets `scalaCompilerBridgeSource` correctly, this reduces the boilerplate needed
  to make a dotty project. Note that dotty support in sbt is still considered
  experimental and not officially supported, see [dotty.epfl.ch][dotty] for
  more information. [#2902][2902] by [@smarter][@smarter]
- Updates sbt new's reference implementation to Giter8 0.7.2.

- Fixes regressions in sbt 0.13.11 - 0.13.13 that processed build-level keys incorrectly. [#2851][2851]/[#2460][2460] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes a regression in sbt 0.13.12 that was misfiring Scala version enforcement when configuration does not extend `Compile`. [#2827][2827]/[#2786][2786] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes Scala binary version checking misfiring on configurations that do not extend `Compile`. [#2828][2828]/[#1466][1466] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

- Fixes null sourceFile causing NPE. [#2766][2766] by [@avdv][@avdv]
- Fixes version parsing in validation. [#3011][3011] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Maven version range improvement

Previously, when the dependency resolver (Ivy) encountered a Maven version range such as `[1.3.0,)`
it would go out to the Internet to find the latest version.
This would result to a surprising behavior where the eventual version keeps changing over time
*even when there's a version of the library that satisfies the range condition*.

Starting sbt 0.13.14, some Maven version ranges would be replaced with its lower bound
so that when a satisfactory version is found in the dependency graph it will be used.
You can disable this behavior using the JVM flag `-Dsbt.modversionrange=false`.

[#2954][2954] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Offline installation

sbt 0.13.14 adds two new repositories called "local-preloaded-ivy"
and "local-preloaded" that point to `~/.sbt/preloaded/`.
The purpose for the repositories is to preload them with
sbt artifacts so the installation of sbt will not require access to the Internet.

This also improves the startup time of sbt when you first run it
since the resolution happens off of a local-preloaded repository.

### Notes

No changes should be necessary to your project definition and all plugins published for sbt 0.13.{x|x<14} should still work.

See [Migrating from sbt 0.12.x](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Migrating-from-sbt-012x.html) for details on the old operator deprecation.

Special thanks to the contributors for making this release a success. According to `git shortlog -sn --no-merges v0.13.13..0.13`, compared to 0.13.13, there were 42 (non-merge) commits, by ten contributors: Dale Wijnand, Eugene Yokota,  Guillaume Martres, Jason Zaugg, Petro Verkhogliad, Eric Richardson, Claudio Bley, Haochi Chen, Paul Draper, Ashley Mercer. Thank you!

### Fixes with compatibility implications

- JCenter is now opt-in. A new setting `useJCenter` can be set to `true` to re-include it, as the first external resolver to find library dependencies. [#2217][2217]/[#2467][2467] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Adds `withInterProjectFirst` to the update option, which is enabled by default. When set to `true`, `inter-project` resolver will be prioritized above all resolvers and Ivy cache. [#1827][1827] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes update option's `withLatestSnapshots` so it handles modules without an artifact. This flag will be enabled by default.
  [#1514][1514]/[#1616][1616]/[#2313][2313] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- No longer passes `-J<flag>` options to the local Java compiler. [#1968][1968]/[#2272][2272] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]
- Fixes auto imports for auto plugins in global configuration files. Because this is *not* source compatible with 0.13.x, the fix is enabled only when `sbt.global.autoimport` flag is `true`. [#2120][2120]/[#2399][2399] by [@timcharper][@timcharper]

### Improvements

- Adds configurable compiler bridge. See below.

- sbt Serialization is updated to 0.1.2. [#2117][2117] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### Configurable Scala compiler bridge

sbt 0.13.11 adds `scalaCompilerBridgeSource` setting to specify the compiler brigde source. This allows different implementation of the bridge for Scala versions, and also allows future versions of Scala compiler implementation to diverge. The source module will be retrieved using library management configured by `bootIvyConfiguration` task.

[#2106][2106]/[#2197][2197]/[#2336][2336] by [@Duhemm][@Duhemm]

### Dotty awareness

sbt 0.13.11 will assume that Dotty is used when `scalaVersion` starts with `0.`.
The built-in compiler bridge in sbt does not support Dotty,
but a separate compiler bridge is being developed at [smarter/dotty-bridge](https://github.com/smarter/dotty-bridge) and
an example project that uses it is available at [smarter/dotty-example-project](https://github.com/smarter/dotty-example-project).

[#2344][2344] by [@smarter][@smarter]

### Inter-project dependency tracking

sbt 0.13.11 adds `trackInternalDependencies` and `exportToInternal` settings. These can be used to control whether to trigger compilation of a dependent subprojects when you call `compile`. Both keys will take one of three values: `TrackLevel.NoTracking`, `TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing`, and `TrackLevel.TrackAlways`. By default they are both set to `TrackLevel.TrackAlways`.

When `trackInternalDependencies` is set to `TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing`, sbt will no longer try to compile internal (inter-project) dependencies automatically, unless there are no `*.class` files (or JAR file when `exportJars` is `true`) in the output directory. When the setting is set to `TrackLevel.NoTracking`, the compilation of internal dependencies will be skipped. Note that the classpath will still be appended, and dependency graph will still show them as dependencies. The motivation is to save the I/O overhead of checking for the changes on a build with many subprojects during development. Here's how to set all subprojects to `TrackIfMissing`.

    lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
      aggregate(....).
      settings(
        inThisBuild(Seq(
          trackInternalDependencies := TrackLevel.TrackIfMissing,
          exportJars := true
        ))
      )

The `exportToInternal` setting allows the dependent subprojects to opt out of the internal tracking, which might be useful if you want to track most subprojects except for a few. The intersection of the `trackInternalDependencies` and `exportToInternal` settings will be used to determine the actual track level. Here's an example to opt-out one project:

    lazy val dontTrackMe = (project in file("dontTrackMe")).
      settings(
        exportToInternal := TrackLevel.NoTracking
      )

[#2266][2266]/[#2354][2354] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Def.settings

Using `Def.settings` it is now possible to nicely define settings as such:

    val modelSettings = Def.settings(
      sharedSettings,
      libraryDependencies += foo
    )

### Rolling back XML parsing workaround

sbt 0.13.7 implemented natural whitespace handling by switching `build.sbt` parsing to use Scala compiler, instead of blank line delimiting. We realized that some build definitions no longer parsed due to the difference in XML handling.

    val a = <x/><y/>
    val b = 0

At the time, we thought adding parentheses around XML nodes could work around this behavior. However, the workaround has caused [more issues][1738], and since then we have realized that this is a compiler issue [SI-9027][SI-9027], so we have decided to roll back our workaround. In the meantime, if you have consecutive XML elements in your build.sbt, enclose them in `<xml:group>` tag, or parentheses.

    val a = <xml:group><x/><y/></xml:group>
    val b = 0

[#1765][1765] by [@ajozwik][@ajozwik]

### Cross-version support for Scala sources

When `crossPaths` setting is set to `true` (it is `true` by default), sbt 0.13.8 will include
`src/main/scala-<scalaBinaryVersion>/` to the `Compile` compilation in addition to
`src/main/scala`. For example, it will include `src/main/scala-2.11/` for Scala 2.11.5, and
`src/main/scala-2.9.3` for Scala 2.9.3. [#1799][1799] by [@indrajitr][@indrajitr]

### Maven resolver plugin

sbt 0.13.8 adds an extension point in the dependency resolution to customize Maven resolvers.
This allows us to write sbt-maven-resolver auto plugin, which internally uses Eclipse Aether
to resolve Maven dependencies instead of Apache Ivy.

To enable this plugin, add the following to `project/maven.sbt` (or `project/plugin.sbt` the file name doesn't matter):

    addMavenResolverPlugin

This will create a new `~/.ivy2/maven-cache` directory, which contains the Aether cache of files.
You may notice some file will be re-downloaded for the new cache layout.
Additionally, sbt will now be able to fully construct
`maven-metadata.xml` files when publishing to remote repositories or when publishing to the local `~/.m2/repository`.
This should help erase many of the deficiencies encountered when using Maven and sbt together.

**Notes and known limitations**:

- sbt-maven-resolver requires sbt 0.13.8 and above.
- The current implementation does not support Ivy-style dynamic revisions, such as "2.10.+" or "latest.snapshot".  This
  is a fixable situation, but the version range query and Ivy -> Maven version range translation code has not been migrated.
- The current implementation does not support Maven-style range revisions if found on transitive dependencies. [#1921][1921]

[#1793][1793] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]

### Project-level dependency exclusions

sbt 0.13.8 adds **experimental** project-level dependency exclusions:

    excludeDependencies += "org.apache.logging.log4j"
    excludeDependencies += "com.example" %% "foo"

In the first example, all artifacts from the organization `"org.apache.logging.log4j"` are excluded from the managed dependency.
In the second example, artifacts with the organization `"com.example"` and the name `"foo"` cross versioned to the current `scalaVersion` are excluded.

**Note**: This feature currently does not translate to `pom.xml`!

[#1748][1748] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Sequential tasks

sbt 0.13.8 adds a new `Def.sequential` function to run tasks under semi-sequential semantics.
Here's an example usage:

    lazy val root = project.
      settings(
        testFile := target.value / "test.txt",
        sideEffect0 := {
          val t = testFile.value
          IO.append(t, "0")
          t
        },
        sideEffect1 := {
          val t = testFile.value
          IO.append(t, "1")
          t
        },
        foo := Def.sequential(compile in Compile, sideEffect0, sideEffect1, test in Test).value
      )

Normally sbt's task engine will reorder tasks based on the dependencies among the tasks,
and run as many tasks in parallel (See [Custom settings and tasks][Custom-Settings0] for more details on this).
`Def.sequential` instead tries to run the tasks in the specified order.
However, the task engine will still deduplicate tasks. For instance, when `foo` is executed, it will only compile once,
even though `test in Test` depends on compile. [#1817][1817]/[#1001][1001] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Nicer ways of declaring project settings

Now a `Seq[Setting[_]]` can be passed to `Project.settings` without the needs for "varargs expansion", ie. `: _*`

Instead of:

    lazy val foo = project settings (sharedSettings: _*)

It is now possible to do:

    lazy val foo = project settings sharedSettings

Also, `Seq[Setting[_]]` can be declared at the same level as individual settings in `Project.settings`, for instance:

    lazy val foo = project settings (
      sharedSettings,
      version := "1.0",
      someMoreSettings
    )

[#1902][1902] by [@dwijnand][@dwijnand]

### Bytecode Enhancers

sbt 0.13.8 adds an extension point whereby users can effectively manipulate java bytecode (.class files) *before* the
incremental compiler attempts to cache the classfile hashes.  This allows libraries like ebean to function with sbt
without corrupting the compiler cache and rerunning compile every few seconds.

This splits the compile task into several subTasks:

1. `previousCompile`:  This task returns the previously persisted `Analysis` object for this project.
2. `compileIncremental`: This is the core logic of compiling Scala/Java files together.   This task actually does the
    work of compiling a project incrementally, including ensuring a minimum number of source files are compiled.
    After this method, all .class files that would be generated by scalac + javac will be available.
3. `manipulateByteCode`: This is a stub task which takes the `compileIncremental` result and returns it.
    Plugins which need to manipulate bytecode are expected to override this task with their own implementation, ensuring
    to call the previous behavior.
4. `compile`:  This task depends on `manipulateBytecode` and then persists the `Analysis` object containing all
    incremental compiler information.

Here's an example of how to hook the new `manipulateBytecode` key in your own plugin:

    manipulateBytecode in Compile := {
      val previous = (manipulateBytecode in Compile).value
      doManipulateBytecode(previous)  // Note: This must return a new Compiler.CompileResult with our changes.
    }

See [#1714][1714] for the full details of the implementation.

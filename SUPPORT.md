Support
=======

For community support please [ask] on StackOverflow with the tag "sbt" (and the name of the sbt plugin(s) if any).

- State the problem or question clearly and provide enough context. Code examples and `build.sbt` are often useful when appropriately edited.
- There's also [Gitter sbt/sbt room][gitter], but Stackoverflow is recommended so others can benefit from the answers.

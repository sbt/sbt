/**
 * A `TupleBuilder` abstracts the work of constructing a tuple data structure such as a `TupleN` or `KList`
 * and extracting values from it.  The `Instance` macro implementation will (roughly) traverse the tree of its argument
 * and ultimately obtain a list of expressions with type `M[T]` for different types `T`.
 * The macro constructs an `Input` value for each of these expressions that contains the `Type` for `T`,
 * the `Tree` for the expression, and a `ValDef` that will hold the value for the input.
 *
 * `TupleBuilder.apply` is provided with the list of `Input`s and is expected to provide three values in the returned BuilderResult.
 * First, it returns the constructed tuple data structure Tree in `input`.
 * Next, it provides the type constructor `representationC` that, when applied to M, gives the type of tuple data structure.
 * For example, a builder that constructs a `Tuple3` for inputs `M[Int]`, `M[Boolean]`, and `M[String]`
 * would provide a Type representing `[L[x]] (L[Int], L[Boolean], L[String])`.  The `input` method
 * would return a value whose type is that type constructor applied to M, or `(M[Int], M[Boolean], M[String])`.
 *
 * Finally, the `extract` method provides a list of vals that extract information from the applied input.
 * The type of the applied input is the type constructor applied to `Id` (`[X] X`).
 * The returned list of ValDefs should be the ValDefs from `inputs`, but with non-empty right-hand sides.

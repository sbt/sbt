   * Output:
   * For the None results, we never defined the value and there was no value to delegate to.
   * For a3, we explicitly defined it to be 3.
   * a4 wasn't defined, so it delegates to a3 according to our delegates function.
   * b4 gets the value for a4 (which delegates to a3, so it is 3) and multiplies by 3
   * a5 is defined as the previous value of a5 + 1 and
   *   since no previous value of a5 was defined, it delegates to a4, resulting in 3+1=4.
   * b5 isn't defined explicitly, so it delegates to b4 and is therefore equal to 9 as well
   * a0 = None
   * b0 = None
   * a1 = None
   * b1 = None
   * a2 = None

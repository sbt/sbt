_Getting Started Guide page 1 of 14._ [[Next|Getting Started Setup]]

This Getting Started Guide will get you started with sbt.

sbt uses a small number of concepts to support flexible and
powerful build definitions. There are not that many concepts, but
sbt is not exactly like other build systems and there are details
you _will_ stumble on if you haven't read the documentation.

The Getting Started Guide covers the concepts you need to know to
create and maintain an sbt build definition.

It is _highly recommended_ to read the Getting Started Guide!

If you are in a huge hurry, the most important conceptual
background can be found in
[[.sbt build definition|Getting Started Basic Def]],
[[scopes|Getting Started Scopes]], and
[[more about settings|Getting Started More About Settings]].  But
we don't promise that it's a good idea to skip the other pages in
the guide.

It's best to read in order, as later pages in the Getting Started
Guide build on concepts introduced earlier.

The guide begins with [[Setup|Getting Started Setup]].

Thanks for trying out sbt and _have fun_!

Artifacts
=========

Selecting default artifacts
===========================

By default, the published artifacts are the main binary jar, a jar
containing the main sources and resources, and a jar containing the API
documentation. You can add artifacts for the test classes, sources, or
API or you can disable some of the main artifacts.

To add all test artifacts:

::

    publishArtifact in Test := true

To add them individually:

::

    // enable publishing the jar produced by `test:package`
    publishArtifact in (Test, packageBin) := true

    // enable publishing the test API jar
    publishArtifact in (Test, packageDoc) := true

    // enable publishing the test sources jar
    publishArtifact in (Test, packageSrc) := true

To disable main artifacts individually:

::

    // disable publishing the main jar produced by `package`
    publishArtifact in (Compile, packageBin) := false

    // disable publishing the main API jar
    publishArtifact in (Compile, packageDoc) := false

    // disable publishing the main sources jar
    publishArtifact in (Compile, packageSrc) := false

Modifying default artifacts
===========================

Each built-in artifact has several configurable settings in addition to
:key:`publishArtifact`. The basic ones are :key:`artifact` (of type
`SettingKey[Artifact]`), :key:`mappings` (of type
`TaskKey[(File,String)]`), and :key:`artifactPath` (of type
`SettingKey[File]`). They are scoped by `(<config>, <task>)` as
indicated in the previous section.

To modify the type of the main artifact, for example:

::

    artifact in (Compile, packageBin) := {
      val previous: Artifact = (artifact in (Compile, packageBin)).value
      previous.copy(`type` = "bundle")
    }

The generated artifact name is determined by the :key:`artifactName`
setting. This setting is of type
`(ScalaVersion, ModuleID, Artifact) => String`. The ScalaVersion
argument provides the full Scala version String and the binary
compatible part of the version String. The String result is the name of
the file to produce. The default implementation is
`Artifact.artifactName _`. The function may be modified to produce
different local names for artifacts without affecting the published
name, which is determined by the :key:`artifact` definition combined with
the repository pattern.

For example, to produce a minimal name without a classifier or cross
path:

::

    artifactName := { (sv: ScalaVersion, module: ModuleID, artifact: Artifact) =>
      artifact.name + "-" + module.revision + "." + artifact.extension
    }

(Note that in practice you rarely want to drop the classifier.)

Finally, you can get the `(Artifact, File)` pair for the artifact by
mapping the :key:`packagedArtifact` task. Note that if you don't need the
`Artifact`, you can get just the File from the package task
(:key:`package`, :key:`packageDoc`, or :key:`packageSrc`). In both cases,
mapping the task to get the file ensures that the artifact is generated
first and so the file is guaranteed to be up-to-date.

For example:

::

    val myTask = taskKey[Unit]("My task.")

    myTask :=  {
      val (art, file) = packagedArtifact.in(Compile, packageBin).value
      println("Artifact definition: " + art)
      println("Packaged file: " + file.getAbsolutePath)
    }

Defining custom artifacts
=========================

In addition to configuring the built-in artifacts, you can declare other
artifacts to publish. Multiple artifacts are allowed when using Ivy
metadata, but a Maven POM file only supports distinguishing artifacts
based on classifiers and these are not recorded in the POM.

Basic `Artifact` construction look like:

::

    Artifact("name", "type", "extension")
    Artifact("name", "classifier")
    Artifact("name", url: URL)
    Artifact("name", Map("extra1" -> "value1", "extra2" -> "value2"))

For example:

::

    Artifact("myproject", "zip", "zip")
    Artifact("myproject", "image", "jpg")
    Artifact("myproject", "jdk15")

See the `Ivy
documentation <http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.3.0-rc1/ivyfile/dependency-artifact.html>`_
for more details on artifacts. See the `Artifact
API <../../api/sbt/Artifact$.html>`_ for
combining the parameters above and specifying [Configurations] and extra
attributes.

To declare these artifacts for publishing, map them to the task that
generates the artifact:

::

    val myImageTask = taskKey[File](...)

    myImageTask := {
      val artifact: File = makeArtifact(...)
      artifact
    }

    addArtifact( Artifact("myproject", "image", "jpg"), myImageTask )

`addArtifact` returns a sequence of settings (wrapped in a
`SettingsDefinition <../../api/#sbt.Init$SettingsDefinition>`_).
In a full build configuration, usage looks like:

::

      ...
      lazy val proj = Project(...)
        .settings( addArtifact(...).settings : _* )
      ...

Publishing .war files
=====================

A common use case for web applications is to publish the `.war` file
instead of the `.jar` file.

::

    // disable .jar publishing 
    publishArtifact in (Compile, packageBin) := false 

    // create an Artifact for publishing the .war file 
    artifact in (Compile, packageWar) := {
      val previous: Artifact = (artifact in (Compile, packageWar)).value
      previous.copy(`type` = "war", extension = "war") 
    } 

    // add the .war file to what gets published 
    addArtifact(artifact in (Compile, packageWar), packageWar) 

Using dependencies with artifacts
=================================

To specify the artifacts to use from a dependency that has custom or
multiple artifacts, use the `artifacts` method on your dependencies.
For example:

::

    libraryDependencies += "org" % "name" % "rev" artifacts(Artifact("name", "type", "ext"))

The `from` and `classifer` methods (described on the :doc:`Library Management <Library-Management>`
page) are actually convenience methods that translate to `artifacts`:

::

      def from(url: String) = artifacts( Artifact(name, new URL(url)) )
      def classifier(c: String) = artifacts( Artifact(name, c) )

That is, the following two dependency declarations are equivalent:

::

    libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" classifier "jdk15"

    libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" artifacts(Artifact("testng", "jdk15") )

Testing
=======

Basics
======

The standard source locations for testing are:

-  Scala sources in `src/test/scala/`
-  Java sources in `src/test/java/`
-  Resources for the test classpath in `src/test/resources/`

The resources may be accessed from tests by using the `getResource`
methods of `java.lang.Class` or `java.lang.ClassLoader`.

The main Scala testing frameworks
(`specs2 <http://specs2.org/>`_,
`ScalaCheck <http://scalacheck.org/>`_, and
`ScalaTest <http://scalatest.org/>`_) provide an
implementation of the common test interface and only need to be added to
the classpath to work with sbt. For example, ScalaCheck may be used by
declaring it as a :doc:`managed dependency <Library-Management>`:

::

    libraryDependencies += "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.10.1" % "test"

The fourth component `"test"` is the :ref:`configuration <gsg-ivy-configurations>`
and means that ScalaCheck will only be on the test classpath and it
isn't needed by the main sources. This is generally good practice for
libraries because your users don't typically need your test dependencies
to use your library.

With the library dependency defined, you can then add test sources in
the locations listed above and compile and run tests. The tasks for
running tests are :key:`test` and :key:`testOnly`. The :key:`test` task
accepts no command line arguments and runs all tests:

.. code-block:: console

    > test

testOnly
---------

The :key:`testOnly` task accepts a whitespace separated list of test names
to run. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    > testOnly org.example.MyTest1 org.example.MyTest2

It supports wildcards as well:

.. code-block:: console

    > testOnly org.example.*Slow org.example.MyTest1

testQuick
----------

The :key:`testQuick` task, like :key:`testOnly`, allows to filter the tests
to run to specific tests or wildcards using the same syntax to indicate
the filters. In addition to the explicit filter, only the tests that
satisfy one of the following conditions are run:

-  The tests that failed in the previous run
-  The tests that were not run before
-  The tests that have one or more transitive dependencies, maybe in a
   different project, recompiled.

Tab completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tab completion is provided for test names based on the results of the
last `test:compile`. This means that a new sources aren't available
for tab completion until they are compiled and deleted sources won't be
removed from tab completion until a recompile. A new test source can
still be manually written out and run using :key:`testOnly`.

Other tasks
-----------

Tasks that are available for main sources are generally available for
test sources, but are prefixed with `test:` on the command line and
are referenced in Scala code with `in Test`. These tasks include:

-  `test:compile`
-  `test:console`
-  `test:consoleQuick`
-  `test:run`
-  `test:runMain`

See :doc:`Running </Getting-Started/Running>` for details on these tasks.

Output
======

By default, logging is buffered for each test source file until all
tests for that file complete. This can be disabled by setting :key:`logBuffered`:

::

    logBuffered in Test := false

Options
=======

Test Framework Arguments
------------------------

Arguments to the test framework may be provided on the command line to
the :key:`testOnly` tasks following a `--` separator. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    > testOnly org.example.MyTest -- -d -S

To specify test framework arguments as part of the build, add options
constructed by `Tests.Argument`:

::

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument("-d", "-g")

To specify them for a specific test framework only:

::

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Argument(TestFrameworks.ScalaCheck, "-d", "-g")

Setup and Cleanup
-----------------

Specify setup and cleanup actions using `Tests.Setup` and
`Tests.Cleanup`. These accept either a function of type `() => Unit`
or a function of type `ClassLoader => Unit`. The variant that accepts
a ClassLoader is passed the class loader that is (or was) used for
running the tests. It provides access to the test classes as well as the
test framework classes.  


.. note::

    When forking, the ClassLoader containing the test classes cannot be provided because it is in another JVM.  Only use the `() => Unit` variants in this case.

Examples:

::

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Setup( () => println("Setup") )

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Cleanup( () => println("Cleanup") )

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Setup( loader => ... )

    testOptions in Test += Tests.Cleanup( loader => ... )

Disable Parallel Execution of Tests
-----------------------------------

By default, sbt runs all tasks in parallel. Because each test is mapped
to a task, tests are also run in parallel by default. To make tests
within a given project execute serially: ::

    parallelExecution in Test := false

`Test` can be replaced with `IntegrationTest` to only execute integration tests serially.
Note that tests from different projects may still execute concurrently.

Filter classes
--------------

If you want to only run test classes whose name ends with "Test", use
`Tests.Filter`:

::

    testOptions in Test := Seq(Tests.Filter(s => s.endsWith("Test")))

Forking tests
-------------

The setting:

::

    fork in Test := true

specifies that all tests will be executed in a single external JVM. See
:doc:`Forking` for configuring standard options for forking. More control
over how tests are assigned to JVMs and what options to pass to those is
available with :key:`testGrouping` key. For example:

::

    import Tests._

    {
      def groupByFirst(tests: Seq[TestDefinition]) =
        tests groupBy (_.name(0)) map {
          case (letter, tests) => new Group(letter.toString, tests, SubProcess(Seq("-Dfirst.letter"+letter)))
        } toSeq;
      testGrouping := groupByFirst( (definedTests in Test).value )
    }

The tests in a single group are run sequentially. Control the number
of forked JVMs allowed to run at the same time by setting the
limit on `Tags.ForkedTestGroup` tag, which is 1 by default.
`Setup` and `Cleanup` actions cannot be provided with the actual
test class loader when a group is forked.

Additional test configurations
==============================

You can add an additional test configuration to have a separate set of
test sources and associated compilation, packaging, and testing tasks
and settings. The steps are:

-  Define the configuration
-  Add the tasks and settings
-  Declare library dependencies
-  Create sources
-  Run tasks

The following two examples demonstrate this. The first example shows how
to enable integration tests. The second shows how to define a customized
test configuration. This allows you to define multiple types of tests
per project.

Integration Tests
-----------------

The following full build configuration demonstrates integration tests.

::

      import sbt._
      import Keys._

    object B extends Build
    {
      lazy val root =
        Project("root", file("."))
          .configs( IntegrationTest )
          .settings( Defaults.itSettings : _*)
          .settings( libraryDependencies += specs )

      lazy val specs = "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "2.0" % "it,test"
    }

-  `configs(IntegrationTest)` adds the predefined integration test
   configuration. This configuration is referred to by the name `it`.
-  `settings( Defaults.itSettings : _* )` adds compilation, packaging,
   and testing actions and settings in the `IntegrationTest`
   configuration.
-  `settings( libraryDependencies += specs )` adds specs to both the
   standard `test` configuration and the integration test
   configuration `it`. To define a dependency only for integration
   tests, use `"it"` as the configuration instead of `"it,test"`.

The standard source hierarchy is used:

-  `src/it/scala` for Scala sources
-  `src/it/java` for Java sources
-  `src/it/resources` for resources that should go on the integration
   test classpath

The standard testing tasks are available, but must be prefixed with
`it:`. For example,

.. code-block:: console

    > it:testOnly org.example.AnIntegrationTest

Similarly the standard settings may be configured for the
`IntegrationTest` configuration. If not specified directly, most
`IntegrationTest` settings delegate to `Test` settings by default.
For example, if test options are specified as:

::

    testOptions in Test += ...

then these will be picked up by the `Test` configuration and in turn
by the `IntegrationTest` configuration. Options can be added
specifically for integration tests by putting them in the
`IntegrationTest` configuration:

::

    testOptions in IntegrationTest += ...

Or, use `:=` to overwrite any existing options, declaring these to be
the definitive integration test options:

::

    testOptions in IntegrationTest := Seq(...)

Custom test configuration
-------------------------

The previous example may be generalized to a custom test configuration.

::

      import sbt._
      import Keys._

    object B extends Build
    {
      lazy val root =
        Project("root", file("."))
          .configs( FunTest )
          .settings( inConfig(FunTest)(Defaults.testSettings) : _*)
          .settings( libraryDependencies += specs )

      lazy val FunTest = config("fun") extend(Test)
      lazy val specs = "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "2.0" % "fun"
    }

Instead of using the built-in configuration, we defined a new one:

::

    lazy val FunTest = config("fun") extend(Test)

The `extend(Test)` part means to delegate to `Test` for undefined
`CustomTest` settings. The line that adds the tasks and settings for
the new test configuration is:

::

    settings( inConfig(FunTest)(Defaults.testSettings) : _*)

This says to add test and settings tasks in the `FunTest`
configuration. We could have done it this way for integration tests as
well. In fact, `Defaults.itSettings` is a convenience definition:
`val itSettings = inConfig(IntegrationTest)(Defaults.testSettings)`.

The comments in the integration test section hold, except with
`IntegrationTest` replaced with `FunTest` and `"it"` replaced with
`"fun"`. For example, test options can be configured specifically for
`FunTest`:

::

    testOptions in FunTest += ...

Test tasks are run by prefixing them with `fun:`

.. code-block:: console

    > fun:test

Additional test configurations with shared sources
--------------------------------------------------

An alternative to adding separate sets of test sources (and
compilations) is to share sources. In this approach, the sources are
compiled together using the same classpath and are packaged together.
However, different tests are run depending on the configuration.

::

    import sbt._
    import Keys._

    object B extends Build {
      lazy val root =
        Project("root", file("."))
          .configs( FunTest )
          .settings( inConfig(FunTest)(Defaults.testTasks) : _*)
          .settings(
            libraryDependencies += specs,
            testOptions in Test := Seq(Tests.Filter(unitFilter)),
            testOptions in FunTest := Seq(Tests.Filter(itFilter))
          )

      def itFilter(name: String): Boolean = name endsWith "ITest"
      def unitFilter(name: String): Boolean = (name endsWith "Test") && !itFilter(name)

      lazy val FunTest = config("fun") extend(Test)
      lazy val specs = "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % "2.0" % "test"
    }

The key differences are:

-  We are now only adding the test tasks
   (`inConfig(FunTest)(Defaults.testTasks)`) and not compilation and
   packaging tasks and settings.
-  We filter the tests to be run for each configuration.

To run standard unit tests, run `test` (or equivalently,
`test:test`):

.. code-block:: console

    > test

To run tests for the added configuration (here, `"fun"`), prefix it
with the configuration name as before:

.. code-block:: console

    > fun:test
    > fun:testOnly org.example.AFunTest

Application to parallel execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One use for this shared-source approach is to separate tests that can
run in parallel from those that must execute serially. Apply the
procedure described in this section for an additional configuration.
Let's call the configuration `serial`:

::

      lazy val Serial = config("serial") extend(Test)

Then, we can disable parallel execution in just that configuration
using:

::

    parallelExecution in Serial := false

The tests to run in parallel would be run with :key:`test` and the ones to
run in serial would be run with `serial:test`.

JUnit
=====

Support for JUnit is provided by
`junit-interface <https://github.com/szeiger/junit-interface>`_. To add
JUnit support into your project, add the junit-interface dependency in
your project's main build.sbt file.

::

    libraryDependencies += "com.novocode" % "junit-interface" % "0.9" % "test"

Extensions
==========

This page describes adding support for additional testing libraries and
defining additional test reporters. You do this by implementing `sbt`
interfaces (described below). If you are the author of the testing
framework, you can depend on the test interface as a provided
dependency. Alternatively, anyone can provide support for a test
framework by implementing the interfaces in a separate project and
packaging the project as an sbt :doc:`Plugin </Extending/Plugins>`.

Custom Test Framework
---------------------

The main Scala testing libraries have built-in support for sbt.
To add support for a different framework, implement the
`uniform test interface <http://github.com/sbt/test-interface>`_.

Custom Test Reporters
---------------------

Test frameworks report status and results to test reporters. You can
create a new test reporter by implementing either
`TestReportListener <../../api/sbt/TestReportListener.html>`_
or
`TestsListener <../../api/sbt/TestsListener.html>`_.

Using Extensions
----------------

To use your extensions in a project definition:

Modify the :key:`testFrameworks` setting to reference your test framework:

::

    testFrameworks += new TestFramework("custom.framework.ClassName")

Specify the test reporters you want to use by overriding the
:key:`testListeners` setting in your project definition.

::

    testListeners += customTestListener

where `customTestListener` is of type `sbt.TestReportListener`.

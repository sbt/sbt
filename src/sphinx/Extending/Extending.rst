=============
Extending sbt
=============

This part of the wiki has pages documenting sbt "internals," and how to
extend them with plugins and commands.

To understand the pages in here, you'll probably need the
:doc:`Getting Started Guide </Getting-Started/Welcome>` as a
foundation.

See the sidebar on the right for an index of topics.

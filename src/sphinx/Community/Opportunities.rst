Opportunites
============

Below is a running list of potential areas of contribution. This list
may become out of date quickly, so you may want to check on the `sbt-dev mailing list`_
if you are interested in a specific topic.

1. There are plenty of possible visualization and analysis
   opportunities.

   -  'compile' produces an Analysis of the source code containing

      -  Source dependencies
      -  Inter-project source dependencies
      -  Binary dependencies (jars + class files)
      -  data structure representing the
         `API <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/tree/0.13/interface>`_ of
         the source code There is some code already for generating dot
         files that isn't hooked up, but graphing dependencies and
         inheritance relationships is a general area of work.

   -  'update' produces an :doc:`/Detailed-Topics/Update-Report` mapping
      `Configuration/ModuleID/Artifact` to the retrieved `File`
   -  Ivy produces more detailed XML reports on dependencies. These come
      with an XSL stylesheet to view them, but this does not scale to
      large numbers of dependencies. Working on this is pretty
      straightforward: the XML files are created in `~/.ivy2` and the
      `.xsl` and `.css` are there as well, so you don't even need to
      work with sbt. Other approaches described in `the email
      thread <https://groups.google.com/group/simple-build-tool/browse_thread/thread/7761f8b2ce51f02c/129064ea836c9baf>`_
   -  Tasks are a combination of static and dynamic graphs and it would
      be useful to view the graph of a run
   -  Settings are a static graph and there is code to generate the dot
      files, but isn't hooked up anywhere.

2. There is support for dependencies on external projects, like on
   GitHub. To be more useful, this should support being able to update
   the dependencies. It is also easy to extend this to other ways of
   retrieving projects. Support for svn and hg was a recent
   contribution, for example.
3. Dependency management: see `adept`_
4. If you like parsers, sbt commands and input tasks are written using
   custom parser combinators that provide tab completion and error
   handling. Among other things, the efficiency could be improved.
5. The javap task hasn't been reintegrated
6. Implement enhanced 0.11-style warn/debug/info/error/trace commands.
   Currently, you set it like any other setting:

.. code-block:: console

      set logLevel := Level.Warn
     or
      set logLevel in Test := Level.Warn

You could make commands that wrap this, like:

.. code-block:: console

      warn test:run

Also, trace is currently an integer, but should really be an abstract
data type.

7. Each sbt version has more aggressive incremental compilation and
reproducing bugs can be difficult. It would be helpful to
have a mode that generates a diff between successive
compilations and records the options passed to scalac. This could be
replayed or inspected to try to find the cause.

Documentation
=============

1. There's a lot to do with this documentation. If you check it out from
   git, there's a directory called Dormant with some content that needs
   going through.

2. the :doc:`main </index>` page mentions external project references (e.g. to a git
   repo) but doesn't have anything to link to that explains how to use
   those.

3. API docs are much needed.

4. Find useful answers or types/methods/values in the other docs, and
   pull references to them up into :doc:`/faq` or :doc:`/Name-Index` so people can
   find the docs. In general the :doc:`/faq` should feel a bit more like a
   bunch of pointers into the regular docs, rather than an alternative
   to the docs.

5. A lot of the pages could probably have better names, and/or little
   2-4 word blurbs to the right of them in the sidebar.

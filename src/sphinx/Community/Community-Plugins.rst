sbt Organization
================
           
The `sbt organization <http://github.com/sbt>`_ is available for use by any sbt plugin.  
Developers who contribute their plugins into the community organization will still retain 
control over their repository and its access.   The goal of the sbt organization is to
organize sbt software into one central location.

A side benefit to using the sbt organization for projects is that you can use gh-pages to host websites in the http://scala-sbt.org domain.

Community Ivy Repository
========================

`Typesafe, Inc. <http://www.typesafe.com>`_ has provided a freely available `Ivy Repository <http://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt>`_ for sbt projects to use.
If you would like to publish your project to this Ivy repository, first contact `sbt-repo-admins <http://groups.google.com/group/sbt-repo-admins?hl=en>`_ and request privileges (we have to verify code ownership, rights to publish, etc.).  After which, you can deploy your plugins using the following configuration:

::

     publishTo := Some(Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases", new URL("http://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns))
     
     publishMavenStyle := false
 
You'll also need to add your credentials somewhere.  For example, you might use a ``~/.sbt/sbtpluginpublish.sbt`` file:
 
::

     credentials += Credentials("Artifactory Realm", "repo.scala-sbt.org", "jsuereth", "@my encrypted password@")
 
Where ``@my encrypted password@`` is actually obtained using the following `instructions <http://wiki.jfrog.org/confluence/display/RTF/Centrally+Secure+Passwords>`_.
 
*Note: Your code must abide by the* `repository polices <Repository-Rules>`_.

To automatically deploy snapshot/release versions of your plugin use the following configuration:

::

    publishTo <<= (version) { version: String =>
       val scalasbt = "http://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/"
       val (name, url) = if (version.contains("-SNAPSHOT"))
         ("sbt-plugin-snapshots", scalasbt+"sbt-plugin-snapshots")
       else
         ("sbt-plugin-releases", scalasbt+"sbt-plugin-releases")
       Some(Resolver.url(name, new URL(url))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns))
    }

*Note: ivy repositories currently don't support Maven-style snapshots.*

 Dormant Pages
===============

If you check out the documentation as a git repository, there's a ``Dormant``
directory (this one) which contains:

-  "redirect" pages (empty pages that point to some new page). If you
   want to rename a page and think it has lots of incoming links from
   outside the wiki, you could leave the old page name in here. The
   directory name is not part of the link so it's safe to move the old
   page into the ``Dormant`` directory.
-  "clipboard" pages that contain some amount of useful text, that needs
   to be extracted and organized, maybe moved to existing pages or the
   :doc:`/faq` or maybe there's a new page that should exist. Basically content
   that may be good but needs massaging into the big picture.

Ideally, pages in here have a note at the top pointing to alternative
content and explaining the status of the page.

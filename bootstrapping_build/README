The standard way to build sbt is with sbt itself. This is called a circular
dependency and poses problems for (linux) distributions that want to build all
their packages from source.

For this special purpose an alternative is provided. The Makefile in the project
root dir compiles a minimal sbt that is then used to compile a full version of
sbt.

THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND DOES NOT YET WORK!

The Makefile has a section of configuration variables at the top, that you may
want to change.

/**
 * Collection of hacks that make it possible for the compiler interface
 * to stay source compatible with Scala compiler 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11.
 *
 * One common technique used in `Compat` class is use of implicit conversions to deal
 * with methods that got renamed or moved between different Scala compiler versions.
 *
 * Let's pick a specific example. In Scala 2.9 and 2.10 there was a method called `toplevelClass`
 * defined on `Symbol`. In 2.10 that method has been deprecated and `enclosingTopLevelClass`
 * method has been introduce as a replacement. In Scala 2.11 the old `toplevelClass` method has
 * been removed. How can we pick the right version based on availability of those two methods?
 *
 * We define an implicit conversion from Symbol to a class that contains both method definitions:
 *
 *   implicit def symbolCompat(sym: Symbol): SymbolCompat = new SymbolCompat(sym)
 *   class SymbolCompat(sym: Symbol) {
 *     def enclosingTopLevelClass: Symbol = sym.toplevelClass
 *     def toplevelClass: Symbol =
 *       throw new RuntimeException("For source compatibility only: should not get here.")
 *   }
 *
 * We assume that client code (code in compiler interface) should always call `enclosingTopLevelClass`
 * method. If we compile that code against 2.11 it will just directly link against method provided by
 * Symbol. However, if we compile against 2.9 or 2.10 `enclosingTopLevelClass` won't be found so the
 * implicit conversion defined above will kick in. That conversion will provide `enclosingTopLevelClass`
 * that simply forwards to the old `toplevelClass` method that is available in 2.9 and 2.10 so that
 * method will be called in the end. There's one twist: since `enclosingTopLevelClass` forwards to
 * `toplevelClass` which doesn't exist in 2.11! Therefore, we need to also define `toplevelClass`
 * that will be provided by an implicit conversion as well. However, we should never reach that method
 * at runtime if either `enclosingTopLevelClass` or `toplevelClass` is available on Symbol so this
 * is purely source compatibility stub.
 *
 * The technique described above is used in several places below.
